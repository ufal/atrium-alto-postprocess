# 📦 ALTO XML Files Postprocessing Pipeline

This project provides a complete workflow for processing **ALTO XML** 📄 files. It takes raw ALTO
XMLs and transforms them into structured **statistics tables** 📊, performs text classification,
and filters low-quality **OCR** 🔍 results.

The core of the quality filtering relies on **language identification** 🌐 and a composite **quality
score** 📈 — combining structural detectors, **perplexity** 📉, and character-level metrics — to identify
and categorize noisy or unreliable **OCR** 🔍 output.

## ⚙️ Setup

Before you begin, set up your environment.

1.  Create and activate a new **virtual environment** 🖥️ in the project directory.
2.  Install the required **Python** 🐍 packages:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
3. Download the **FastText** 🌐 model for language identification:
    ```bash
    wget "[https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification/resolve/main/model.bin](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification/resolve/main/model.bin)" -O lid.176.bin
    ```
4. Clone and install `alto-tools` 🔧, which is used for statistics and text extraction in low memory environments:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools.git](https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools.git)
    cd alto-tools
    pip install .
    cd ..
    ```
5. Copy the `v3` folder from the 📐`layoutreader` 🔧 repository [^9] to the project directory for the LR-based text extraction method:
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader.git](https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader.git)
    cp -r layoutreader/v3/ ./
    rm -rf layoutreader/
    ```

You are now ready to start the workflow.

---


## 🛤️ Workflow Stages

The process is divided into sequential steps, starting from raw **ALTO** 📄 files and ending
with extracted linguistic and statistic data 📊.

You can run the **entire pipeline end-to-end** with a single command (see below), or run each
stage individually as described in Steps 1–4.

---

### 🚀 Run the whole pipeline at once

The [run_pipeline.py](run_pipeline.py) 🐍 orchestrator runs every stage sequentially
(**split → statistics → text extraction → classification → aggregation**) and, at the end,
**merges all per-stage paradata** 🗒️ logs into a single run summary describing every stage, the
intermediate file formats produced, and the **effective end-to-end output license** ⚖️ (see
[Paradata logging](#paradata-logging)).

```bash
python3 run_pipeline.py                      # all settings from config_langID.txt
python3 run_pipeline.py --method glm         # override just the extraction backend
python3 run_pipeline.py --skip-split         # PAGE_ALTO already populated
python3 run_pipeline.py --dry-run            # print the resolved plan, run nothing
```

* **Configuration ⚙️:** every setting is read from [config_langID.txt](config_langID.txt) 📎
(section `[PIPELINE]`, with `INPUT_CSV` taken from `[EXTRACT]`). Precedence is
**CLI flag > config value > built-in default**. Point at a different config with `--config`
or the `LANGID_CONFIG` environment variable.
* **Extraction method 🔀:** `[PIPELINE] METHOD` selects the **Step 3** backend —
`alto-tools`, `layoutreader` (**default**), or `glm`. The choice flows through to the merged
license: a **LayoutReader** 📐 run resolves to **CC BY-NC-SA 4.0**, an **alto-tools** 🧰 run to
**CC BY-NC 4.0**.
* **Output 📤:** a merged `<YYMMDD-HHmmss>_pipeline-run.json` in the [paradata](paradata) 📁
directory, alongside the individual per-stage logs.

> [!NOTE]
> `page_split.py` (Step 1) does not emit paradata of its own, so a full run typically merges
> **four** logged stages (Steps 2–4 plus aggregation). The merged license is re-derived from the
> **union** of components used across all stages, so the end-to-end most-restrictive rule holds.

> [!TIP]
> Prefer to inspect or re-run a single stage? The individual scripts below remain fully usable on
> their own — the orchestrator simply calls them in order.

---

### ▶️ Step 1: Split Document-Specific ALTOs into Pages ✂️

First, ensure you have a directory 📁 containing your document-level `<file>.alto.xml` files.
This script will split them into individual page-specific **XML** 📄 files.

```
python3 page_split.py <input_dir> <output_dir>
```

Each page-specific file retains the header from its original source document 📌.

* **Input 📥:** `../ALTO/` (input directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 documents)
* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_ALTO/` (output directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 files split into pages)

Example of the output directory with divided per-page XML files: [PAGE_ALTO](data_samples/PAGE_ALTO) 📁.

```
PAGE_ALTO/
├── <file1>
│   ├── <file1>-<page>.alto.xml
│   └── ...
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.alto.xml
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

---

### ▶️ Step 2: Create Page Statistics Table 📈

Next, use the output directory from Step 1 as the input for this script to generate a
foundational **CSV** 📊 statistics file.

```
python3 alto_stats_create.py <input_dir> -o output.csv
```

This script writes a **CSV** 📊 file line-by-line, capturing metadata for each page:

```
file, page, textlines, illustrations, graphics, strings, path
CTX200205348, 1, 33, 1, 10, 163, /lnet/.../A-PAGE/CTX200205348/CTX200205348-1.alto.xml
CTX200205348, 2, 0, 1, 12, 0, /lnet/.../A-PAGE/CTX200205348/CTX200205348-2.alto.xml
...

```

The extraction is powered by the **alto-tools** 🔧 framework [^1](https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools).

* **Input 📥:** `../PAGE_ALTO/` (input directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 files split into pages from Step 1)
* **Output 📤:** `output.csv` (table with page-level statistics and paths to ALTO files)

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This statistics table is the basis for subsequent processing steps.
> Example: [test_alto_stats.csv](data_samples/test_alto_stats.csv) 📎.

---

### ▶️ Step 3: Extract text from ALTO XML ⛏️

This script runs in parallel ⚡ (using multiple **CPU** 💻 cores) to extract text from **ALTO XMLs** 📄 into `.txt` 📝 files.
It reads the **CSV** 📊 from Step 2.

* **Input 1 📥:** `output.csv` (from Step 2)
* **Input 2 📥:** `../PAGE_ALTO/` (input directory with **ALTO XML** 📄 files split into pages from Step 1)
* **Output 📤:** `../PAGE_TXT/` or `../PAGE_TXT_LR/` (directory containing raw **text** 📝 files)

#### 1st choice: LayoutReader method 📐

> [!CAUTION]
> The model responsible for spatial layout 📐 analysis requires a **GPU** 🚀 to run efficiently.

```
python3 extract_LytRdr_ALTO_2_TXT.py
```

Uses the **LayoutReader** 📐 framework [^9](https://github.com/ppaanngggg/layoutreader) to extract text and bounding boxes of **XML** 📄 elements
(specifically, `<TextLine>` elements containing `String`s with `CONTENT` attribute),
process them to reconstruct the reading order of lines (columns-friendly), handle words split
between two lines (adding the full form of the word), and group page contents into paragraphs
based on the vertical spread of text lines.

Example of per-page text files: [PAGE_TXT_LR](data_samples/PAGE_TXT_LR) 📁.

```
PAGE_TXT_LR/
├── <file1>
│   ├── <file1>-<page>.txt
│   └── ...
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.txt
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

---

#### 2nd option: alto-tools method 🧰

> [!NOTE]
> The method is **CPU** 💻-bound and faster than the LayoutReader method, but the text lines may not be in the correct
> reading order, and full forms of hyphenated split words are not reconstructed.

```
python3 extract_ALTO_2_TXT.py
```

Uses the `alto-tools` 🔧 framework [^1](https://github.com/cneud/alto-tools) to extract text lines from **XML** 📄 elements directly,
with no post-processing. Suitable for a quick overview of raw text content.

Example of per-page text files: [PAGE_TXT](data_samples/PAGE_TXT) 📁.

```
PAGE_TXT/
├── <file1>
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.txt
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

---

#### 3rd alternative: GLM method (LLM-based) 🤖

> [!WARNING]
> The method is **GPU** 🚀-bound, slower than the LayoutReader method, and requires a `gpuram48G` card.

```
python3 extract_LLM_ALTO_2_TXT.py
```

Uses the **GLM-4v-9b** 🤖 multimodal large language model [^10](https://huggingface.co/THUDM/glm-4v-9b) to perform generative **OCR** 🔍 directly from
page images, prompted as `Transcribe all text on this page exactly as it appears`. The script
trims whitespace and resizes high-resolution images to fit model constraints.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is significantly slower than parsing **XML** 📄 but often yields higher quality text for complex
> layouts 📐 or degraded scans. It patches the transformers configuration to run the GLM-4v architecture.

Example of per-page text files: [PAGE_TXT_LLM](data_samples/PAGE_TXT_LLM) 📁.

```
PAGE_TXT_LLM/
├── <file1>
├── <file2>
│   ├── <file2>-<page>.txt
│   └── ...
└── ...
```

---

### ▶️ Step 4: Classify Page Text Quality & Language 🗂️

This is a key ⌛ time-consuming step that analyzes the **text quality** 📈 of each page line-by-line,
assigning each line a quality category to filter out **OCR** 🔍 noise.

It uses the [FastText language identification model](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) 🌐
and **perplexity** 📉 scores from [Qwen2.5-0.5B](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B) 🤖 to detect noise [^2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) [^6](https://huggingface.co/Qwen/Qwen2.5-0.5B).

More post-processing of **TXT** 📝 files can be found in the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich)
of the ATRIUM project, which covers NLP enrichment using Nametag for NER and UDPipe for CONLL-U files with lemmas & POS tags [^5](https://github.com/ufal/atrium-nlp-enrich).

As the script processes, it assigns each line one of five categories 🪧:

| Category        | Action                                             | Description                                                                                                                                                                    |
|-----------------|----------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| ✅ **Clear**     | Ready to be processed by further NLP               | Passes all structural checks; high composite **quality score** 📈.                                                                                                             |
| ⚠️ **Noisy**    | Corrections of generally readable words are needed | Partially degraded: moderate **quality score** 📈 indicating isolated symbol issues, fused tokens, mid-word uppercase, or elevated **perplexity** 📉.                          |
| 🗑️ **Trash**   | Should be re-processed by another **OCR** 🔍 tool  | Severely corrupted: composite **quality score** 📈 below the Trash threshold, or routed here by an override (unreadable all-caps line, inverted-scan page block).              |
| 🔣 **Non-text** | May be checked for identifiers of finds/sites      | Filtered by the CPU 💻 pre-filter: line is too short, has too few unique symbols, contains fewer than 30% alphabetic characters, or consists mostly of digits and punctuation. |
| 🫙 **Empty**    | Can be ignored                                     | Line contains only whitespace (paragraphs separator)                                                                                                                           |

> [!NOTE]
> This script generates two primary output directories:
> `DOC_LINE_LANG_CLASS/` and `DOC_LINE_STATS/`, while the
> raw **text** 📝 files (primary input) are stored in `../PAGE_TXT/` generated from `../PAGE_ALTO/`.

All input/output paths and tunable parameters are configured ⚙️ in [config_langID.txt](config_langID.txt) 📎.
Parameters are organized into **three sections**: `[CLASSIFY]`, `[AGGREGATE]`, and `[TEXT_UTILS]`.

Parameters that scale with the **perplexity** 📉 model:

These parameters must be re-tuned whenever you switch between multilingual `Qwen2.5-0.5B`🤖 and English-adapted `distilgpt2`🤖,
because the two models produce **perplexity** 📉 on very different numerical scales — `Qwen2.5-0.5B`🤖 assign scores roughly 3× lower
than `distilgpt2`🤖 on the same Czech 🇨🇿 text:

| Parameter                  | Qwen2.5-0.5B | distilgpt2 | What it controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
|----------------------------|--------------|------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `PERPLEXITY_THRESHOLD_MAX` | 1000.0       | 3000.0     | The ceiling used to normalise raw **perplexity** 📉 into [0, 1] for the **quality score** 📈. A value at or above this ceiling contributes 0 to the score (worst); a value of 0 contributes 1 (best).                                                                                 |
| `SHORT_PPL_CAP`            | 850.0        | 2500.0     | Maximum **perplexity** 📉 applied to 1–2 word lines before quality scoring. Short text fragments receive extreme **perplexity** 📉 scores from any LM because there is no context to condition on; this cap prevents legitimate short labels and codes from being unfairly penalised. |
| `PPL_INVERTED_MIN`         | 200.0        | 500.0      | **Perplexity** 📉 floor for the inverted-scan detection arm. A line is considered a candidate for the inverted-scan penalty only if the LM is also uncertain about it (**perplexity** 📉 above this value).                                                                           |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_PPL_MAX`      | 400.0        | 1000.0     | Maximum **perplexity** 📉 a line may have to qualify for the near-boundary `Clear` promotion (Override 4). Lines with **perplexity** 📉 above this value are not promoted even if all other conditions are met.                                                                       |

Parameters that are model-independent 🤖 and stable across different choices of **perplexity** 📉 model 🤖:

These parameters are expressed as ratios or quality-score fractions, not as **perplexity** 📉 values, so their meaning
does not change between models and their defaults are stable across either choice:

| Parameter                   | Default | What it controls                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
|-----------------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `ROT_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN`    | 0.55    | Minimum fraction of structurally rotatable characters (`pbqdnuwmoxszeyv`) among alphabetic characters that must be present before a rotation penalty is even considered. A value of 0.55 means more than half of all letters in the line must belong to this ambiguous set. |
| `WEIRD_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN`  | 0.35    | Minimum mean per-word weirdness score required to *confirm* an inverted scan when `rot_ratio` is already above the threshold. This second condition prevents Czech 🇨🇿 sentences that happen to contain many `p`, `d`, `b`, `q` letters from being falsely penalised.      |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_MIN_SCORE`     | 0.65    | Lower bound of the quality-score range within which the near-boundary promotion (Override 4) can fire. A line must score at least this well before it is a candidate for promotion from `Noisy` to `Clear`.                                                                 |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_WEIRD_MAX`     | 0.08    | Maximum mean per-word weirdness a line may have to qualify for the near-boundary promotion. Even a single notably corrupted token disqualifies the line from being promoted.                                                                                                |
| `CLEAN_PROSE_WC_MIN`        | 4       | Minimum word count a line must have to qualify for near-boundary promotion. Very short lines (1–3 words) have unreliable **perplexity** 📉 scores and are therefore never promoted regardless of their **quality score** 📈.                                                |
| `MOSTLY_READABLE_VALID_MIN` | 0.85    | Minimum ratio of structurally valid words required.

#### 4.1 Classify Lines (GPU Bound) 🚀

This script reads the extracted **text** 📝 files, batches lines together 📦, and runs the **FastText** 🌐 and
**Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 models. It uses a **CPU** 💻/**GPU** 🚀 split architecture:

* A single dedicated **GPU** 🚀 worker holds the only **Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 instance and processes **perplexity** 📉 batches to
prevent VRAM OOM errors.
* Multiple **CPU** 💻 workers (up to `WORKERS_MAX`, default 32) read files, run **FastText** 🌐 and structural detectors, and
submit text batches to the **GPU** 🚀 worker via a shared queue. **CPU** 💻 workers poll the result dictionary while the GPU
processes, running **language identification** 🌐 concurrently.

> [!WARNING]
> The **first** item of `EXPECTED_LANGS` list of languages 🌐 should be the most expected language in the processed
> collection to work as a default replacement of ambiguous language recognition predictions.

`<doc_name>.csv` 📊: Detailed classification results for every single line within a document, **columns**:

* `file` — document identifier 🆔
* `page_num` — page number 📄
* `line_num` — line number, starts from 1 for each page 🔢
* `text` — cleaned text of the line 📝
* `original_text` — original pre-repair text of the line 📝
* `split_ws` — hyphenated word prefix at the end of the line (split word start)
* `split_we` — hyphenated word suffix at the start of the line (split word end)
* `word_count` — **count** of whitespace-delimited tokens in the line (**count** of **words**)
* `char_count` — **count** of total character in the cleaned line
* `garbage_density` — ratio of non-alphanumeric characters to total line length (calculated on `original_text`)
* `upper` — **count** of **words** with unexpected mid-word uppercase letters
* `repeated` — **count** of **words** where a non-standard character makes up ≥ 30% of the word, or containing consecutive doubled garble characters
* `ldl_fuses` — **count** of **words** with a letter–digit–letter sandwich (e.g., `vyt1ačená`), excluding valid measurements.
* `fused_words` — **count** of tokens that appear to be fused **words** (abnormal consonant/vowel runs or extreme length)
* `gibberish` — **count** of **words** flagged as gibberish (high vowel ratio)
* `weird_wx` — **count** of words with an abnormal density of 'w' or 'x' glyphs
* `word_weird` — mean per-word weirdness score in [0, 1]; combines strange-symbol (0.40), repeated-char (0.35), LDL-fusion (0.15), mid-uppercase (0.10), and a `WORD_W_PENALTY`-weighted (default 0.20) signal for tokens containing the letter `w` — rare in Czech and a strong inverted/mirror-OCR fingerprint — plus a separate caps-prefix penalty (0.20). The combined score is clamped to [0, 1]. Isolated single letters score 0.85 (OCR noise) or 0.25 (digit/measurement).
* `vowel_ratio` — ratio of vowel characters to total alphabetic and symbol characters in the `original_text`
* `rot_ratio` — the ratio of structurally ambiguous/rotatable characters (`pbqdnuwmoxszeyv`) to the total number of alphabetic characters in the line.

##### `<doc_name>.csv`'s key resulting output **columns** that depict the final classification and quality assessment:

* `quality_score` — composite **quality score** 📈 in [0, 1] based on **9** combined signals; higher = cleaner
* `categ` — assigned category: **Clear** ✅, **Noisy** ⚠️, **Trash** 🗑️, **Non-text** 🔣, or **Empty** 🫙

##### `<doc_name>.csv`'s **columns** useful for archive managers information apart from the **quality score** 📈 and category:

* `lang` — predicted ISO **language code** from the **FastText** 🌐 model (remapped if unknown)
* `lang_score` — **FastText** 🌐 confidence score for the predicted language (capped if remapped, #3)
* `original_lang` — predicted language **before** remapping logic
* `orig_lang_score` — original **FastText** confidence **before** remapping
* `perplex` — Qwen2.5-0.5B 🤖 **perplexity** 📉 score of the line 📉
* `caps_header` — **boolean** flag indicating whether all alphabetic words in the line are uppercase (typical of section headers)

**Diagnostic flags (#3):**
Ten boolean audit columns follow `caps_header`. Six name the categoriser rule that decided the line —
`allcaps_novowel`, `lowppl_clear`, `cleanprose_clear`, `trash_threshold`, `noisy_threshold`, `clear_threshold`
(exactly one `True`, or none for `Empty`). Two further internal reason codes — `trash_hard_sweep` (route 1a)
and `trash_inverted` (route 1b) — also exist but are folded into the `trash_threshold` column rather than
getting their own column, so the per-line reason granularity is coarser in the CSV than inside the categoriser.
Four name the document-level post-pass that later changed it — `pp_dedup` (header/footer mode-harmonisation),
`pp_surrounded_trash` (rolling-window smoothing), `pp_inverted_run` (page-level inverted-scan sweep), and
`pp_page_context` (page-context Trash/Noisy adjustment, see below).
A categoriser flag and a `pp_` flag may both be `True` on one line: that is the intended trail from the
original decision to the override.

##### CPU 💻 Pre-filter

Before any **GPU** 🚀 or model inference, `pre_filter_line()` applies a fast **CPU** 💻-side check and assigns `Empty` or `Non-text`
directly, bypassing the ML pipeline entirely. It also applies two lightweight **OCR** 🔍 text repairs to every line before
the rules are evaluated.

Firstly, two fixes correct the most common systematic **OCR** 🔍 substitution errors before any rule is checked. They modify
the text that is passed forward but do not on their own affect what category a line receives.

* **Digit-for-letter substitution:** A `1` surrounded by alphabetic characters on both sides is replaced with `l`
(e.g., `poh1ed` → `pohled`); a `2` at the start of a token followed immediately by a lowercase letter is replaced
with `z`. These substitutions reflect common **OCR** 🔍 confusions between visually similar characters.
* **Spaced-letter collapse:** A sequence of individually spaced single uppercase letters (`P R A H A`) is recognised
as a prostrkávání/spaced-text typographic style and collapsed back into a normally-cased word (`Praha`). Without this
repair, spaced words fail the letter-ratio check and would be discarded as `Non-text`.

1. Line is blank or contains only whitespace → `Empty`
2. Line consists entirely of digits, arithmetic/date separators, and punctuation with no letters → `Non-text` (e.g. `1998`, `5.3.`, `- 14 -`)
3. Line is a Roman numeral, optionally followed by a period → `Non-text` (e.g. `XIV.`, `iii`)
4. Line is a standalone alphanumeric archive or inventory code — a short letter prefix of up to 3 characters
followed by 3 or more digits, with an optional slash-separated suffix → `Non-text` (e.g. `A1739`, `CTX200205348`, `A679/2015`)
5. Line matches a stamp-like ratio pattern — a short alphanumeric string, optional non-alphanumeric characters,
two 2-to-4 digit numbers separated by a `/`, and optional trailing non-alphanumeric characters → `Non-text`
(e.g., `123/456`, `1998/01`, `NZ1998/01`)
6. Fewer than 4 total characters, or fewer than 3 unique non-whitespace symbols → `Non-text`
(lines this short cannot carry meaningful archaeological text)
7. Alphabetic characters make up less than 30% of total characters → `Non-text`
(the line is dominated by digits, punctuation, or special characters)
8. **Isolated Chars & Fusions**: A line dominated by isolated alphanumeric tokens, or a single token fusing letters, digits, and symbols → `Non-text`.
9. **Otherwise** → forwarded for ML classification as `Process`

Finally, two categories of exception send a line directly to `Process` even if it would otherwise be caught by a `Non-text` rule:

* **Metadata marker bypass** — If the line contains any of the following patterns (checked case-insensitively),
it is forwarded as **Process** regardless of how short it is or how few letters it contains. These strings are
structural metadata markers specific to Czech 🇨🇿 archaeological report forms. Without this bypass they would be
discarded as `Non-text` because they are typically very short, heavily abbreviated, or contain mostly punctuation —
but their presence is meaningful for downstream NLP and archival cataloguing:

| Marker                                                    | Typical context in Czech 🇨🇿 archaeological records |
|-----------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| `Tb.`                                                     | Table reference abbreviation (Czech 🇨🇿: *tabulka*) |
| `č.neg`, `č. neg`, `č neg`, `č.neg.`, `č. neg.`, `č neg.` | Negative number reference (*číslo negativu*)         |
| `neg.`, `neg `                                            | Negative reference shorthand                         |
| `obr.`, `obr `                                            | Figure reference (*obrázek*)                         |
| `č.`                                                      | General Czech 🇨🇿 number abbreviation (*číslo*)     |
| `str.`                                                    | Page abbreviation (*strana*)                         |
| `Datum`                                                   | Date field label on standard report forms            |

* **High digit-ratio bypass** — If digits make up more than 40% of the line's total characters, the line is
forwarded as **Process** regardless of its letter ratio. This preserves content-bearing strings that are intentionally
numeric-heavy: measurement records (e.g., `váha 90,9g`, `30–50 cm`), date strings (e.g., `5.XI.1946`), grid
coordinates, and catalogue references that combine letters and numbers. Without this bypass, most measurement lines
would be discarded by rule 7 above.

##### Language 🌐 Handling

**FastText** 🌐 [^2](https://huggingface.co/facebook/fasttext-language-identification) is run on the **lowercased** line text and returns a predicted ISO 639-3 language code
(e.g. `ces` for Czech 🇨🇿, `deu` for German 🇩🇪) and a confidence score between 0 and 1. The pipeline then applies
a series of remapping rules (`remap_lang()` in [text_util_langID.py](text_util_langID.py)📎) before the `lang` and
`lang_score` fields are finalised for storage and before the score is used in quality computation.

**Configuration keys (in `[CLASSIFY]`):**

* `EXPECTED_LANGS` — comma-separated list of language 🌐 codes the collection is expected to contain (e.g., `ces,deu,eng`).
The **first** entry is the **default fallback language** used when **FastText** 🌐 predicts a language that is not in
either `EXPECTED_LANGS` or `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS`. If your collection is primarily Czech 🇨🇿, `ces` should be
first. If your collection is primarily German 🇩🇪 archival material, put `deu` first and adjust the **perplexity** 📉
thresholds accordingly.
* `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS` — comma-separated list of foreign languages 🌐 whose presence in the collection is considered
genuine and should be kept as-is. A language belongs in this list if you expect real documents or passages
in that language (e.g., German-language summaries in a Czech 🇨🇿 report, Latin citations, English 🇬🇧 abstracts).
Languages on this list are **not remapped** to the default, regardless of confidence.

**Language score thresholds (in `[TEXT_UTILS]`):**

* `LANG_SCORE_REMAP = 0.75` — the confidence value applied to unknown Latin-script lines force-remapped to the collection default.
* `LANG_SCORE_REMAP_FAR = 0.50` — the confidence value applied to unknown non-Latin-script lines (Hangul, Cyrillic, CJK, …) force-remapped to the collection default.
* `LANG_SCORE_ROUGH = 0.45` — a **FastText** 🌐 confidence below this is considered too unreliable to trust. This threshold
is used both by the hard-sweep override and by the page-level inverted-scan sweep (see [Post-Processing Smoothing](#post-processing-smoothing))
to identify lines/pages where **FastText** 🌐 cannot confidently assign any language — a strong signal that the content is not readable text.
* `LANG_SCORE_CLEAR = 0.75` — reserved for future use; not currently read by any categorisation or scoring path.

**Remapping logic (applied per line, in order):**

1. If the predicted language 🌐 code appears in `EXPECTED_LANGS` or `TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS` → the **FastText** 🌐 prediction
and confidence score are **kept unchanged**. No remapping occurs.
2. If the predicted language is `slk` (Slovak), it is considered a near-twin of Czech and is remapped to the collection default, but its **original score is preserved**.
3. If the predicted language 🌐 is **not** in either set and not Slovak (e.g., **FastText** 🌐 guesses Danish `dan` on a
Czech 🇨🇿 line) → the language 🌐 code is **force-remapped** to the **first entry of `EXPECTED_LANGS`** (the collection
default), and the stored `lang_score` is replaced according to the `LANG_REMAP_ALWAYS` switch below.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **`LANG_REMAP_ALWAYS`** (`[TEXT_UTILS]`, default **`true`**) controls how the replacement score in step 3 is computed:
> * **`true` (default):** the stored `lang_score` is **unconditionally set** to `LANG_SCORE_REMAP` (**0.75**, Latin-script guess)
>   or `LANG_SCORE_REMAP_FAR` (**0.50**, non-Latin-script guess), regardless of what FastText originally reported. A weak
>   *and* a strong foreign guess both land on the same fixed value.
> * **`false`:** restores the earlier *cap-not-floor* behaviour — the stored score becomes `min(original_score, cap)`,
>   using the same two cap values. A weak original guess is left untouched below the cap; only a confident foreign guess
>   is pulled down. A *confident* foreign guess on Czech archival data is evidence of inverted or garbled **OCR** 🔍, not
>   of trustworthy language ID, so capping (rather than flooring) keeps the stored score honestly low.
>
> Either way, this switch only changes the **stored** `lang_score` and the `QS_WEIGHT_LANG` input. It has **no effect**
> on `orig_lang_score` — the pre-remapping **FastText** 🌐 confidence — which is passed through unchanged and is what
> actually drives the hard-sweep, wqx/rotation, and vowelless overrides in [Categorisation Logic](#categorisation-logic).

##### Structural Detectors

Lines that pass the pre-filter are analysed by structural detectors defined in [text_util_langID.py](text_util_langID.py)📎:

| Detector                     | What it counts                                                                                                                                                                             |
|------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `detect_strange_symbols`     | **Occurrences** of any character that is not alphanumeric and not in the **allowed** set `{ . - , + ( ) " ' — – : % ; ? ! / }`. Edge punctuation is stripped before inspection.            |
| `detect_letter_digit_letter` | Words with a **letter–digit–letter sandwich** — the fingerprint of **OCR** 🔍 digit insertions mid-word (e.g., `vyt1ačená`). **Legitimate** measurements (`30cm`, `90,9g`) do not trigger. |
| `detect_mid_uppercase`       | Words with unexpected uppercase mid-word (`dalSÍ`). Academic titles (`PhDr`, `MUDr`) are **excluded**.                                                                                     |
| `detect_repeated_chars`      | Words with triple character runs, or double runs occurring ≥3 times. Exempts vowels `o, u` and digits to protect legitimate Czech 🇨🇿 doubles (e.g., *denní*).                            |
| `detect_gibberish_words`     | Words of length ≥ 4 with a vowel ratio above `VOWEL_RATIO_HIGH` (0.70). All-caps and mostly numeric words are **excluded**. Sub-tokens are split on internal punctuation first.            |
| `compute_rotatable_ratio`    | Measures the concentration of structurally ambiguous/rotatable letters (`pbqdnuwmoxszeyv`) to catch severe visual noise interpreting graphical textures as characters.                     |
| `detect_fused_words`         | Counts tokens that are likely multiple words merged without a space (token length > 14, consonant run of 5+, or vowel run of 3+). Sub-tokens are split on internal punctuation first.      |
| `detect_wx_words`            | Tokens with an abnormal density of 'w'/'x' glyphs (≥ 2 per sub-token). By default, this is folded into the gibberish ratio to punish severe mirror scans.                                  |

##### Composite Quality Score

After structural detection, each line receives a single floating-point `quality_score` 📈 in [0, 1] computed by
`compute_quality_score()` in [text_util_langID.py](text_util_langID.py)📎. The score is a weighted sum of **nine**
normalised signals, **dynamically divided by the total sum of weights** to strictly bound the maximum
score to 1.0 (preventing score inflation):

```text
base_score =
    QS_WEIGHT_VALID_WORD  (def: 0.35) × valid_word_ratio
  + QS_WEIGHT_WEIRD       (def: 0.18) × (1 − min(word_weird_ratio, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_PERPLEXITY  (def: 0.08) × (1 − min(perplexity / PERPLEXITY_THRESHOLD_MAX, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_LENGTH      (def: 0.02) × min(char_count / QS_LENGTH_MAX, 1.0)
  + active_garbage_wt     (def: 0.18) × (1 − min(garbage_density / QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_VOWEL       (def: 0.07) × vowel_quality_score
  + QS_WEIGHT_LANG        (def: 0.05) × lang_score
  + QS_WEIGHT_GIBBERISH   (def: 0.04) × (1 − min(gibberish_ratio, 1.0))
  + QS_WEIGHT_FUSED       (def: 0.03) × (1 − min(fused_ratio, 1.0))

quality_score = max(0.0, (base_score / total_weight) − short_penalty)
```

> [!NOTE]
> There is no `symbol_ratio` term and no `rot_penalty` subtraction in the current implementation — both
> appeared in earlier revisions. Symbol density is no longer fed into the quality score (the `symbol`
> per-line column has also been removed); rotation/inversion is now handled entirely by the
> per-line lexicon override and the page-level sweep described elsewhere in this document. `compute_quality_score()`
> still accepts an `is_upright_czech` parameter for signature compatibility, but it has no effect on the computed value.

> [!NOTE]
> **(B2) `QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX` vs. `CATEG_GARBAGE_DENSITY_HIGH`.** The garbage-density term inside the quality-score
> formula is now normalised against its own constant, `QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX` (default **0.35**), separate from
> `CATEG_GARBAGE_DENSITY_HIGH` (also default **0.35**), which gates the hard Trash override in
> [Categorisation Logic](#categorisation-logic). The two constants were previously the same value reused in both
> places, which made their individual contribution to the importance sweep inseparable. At default configuration
> both equal 0.35, so behaviour is bit-identical to before; they can now be tuned independently.

**Dynamic adjustments inside `compute_quality_score()` formula:**

**1. Garbage Penalty Guard (short clean strings)**

*Trigger:* `char_count ≤ 12`, `word_weird == 0.0`, **and** `garbage_density < QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX`.

*What happens:* `active_garbage_wt` is **halved** from `QS_WEIGHT_GARBAGE` (default 0.18) to 0.09. A compensating
constant of the same amount is added back to `base_score` so the total effective weight sum is unchanged and the
maximum possible score remains 1.0.

*Why:* Short archival label strings — `Lokalita:`, `Osada:`, `Okres:`, `Datum:` — contain a colon or other
structural punctuation that is counted as "garbage". Since the line is short, completely structurally clean (no weirdness),
and mostly legible, the reduced weight prevents the label from being unfairly penalised.

**2. Short Noisy Strings Penalty (`SHORT_NOISY_QS_PENALTY`)**

*Trigger:* `char_count ≤ 12` **and** (`word_weird > 0.0` **or** `garbage_density ≥ QS_GARBAGE_NORM_MAX`).

*Applied:* Subtracts the configurable `SHORT_NOISY_QS_PENALTY` (default 0.20) directly from the final score
(the result is floored at 0.0).

*Why:* An opt-in penalty to sink very short noisy strings that might otherwise artificially float into acceptable score ranges due to their minimal features.

**3. Short **Perplexity** 📉 Cap (`SHORT_PPL_CAP`)**

*Trigger:* `word_count ≤ 2` **and** raw LM **perplexity** 📉 `> SHORT_PPL_CAP` (default **850.0** for Qwen2.5-0.5B 🤖,
**2500.0** for distilgpt2 🤖).

*Applied:* in `langID_classify.py`, **before** `compute_quality_score()` is called. The **perplexity** 📉 value
*passed to scoring* is clamped to `SHORT_PPL_CAP`. **The stored `perplex` column in the output **CSV** 📊 is not
changed**.

*Why:* Language models assign **perplexity** 📉 by predicting tokens. With only 1–2
words, there is almost no context available, so the model assigns extremely high **perplexity** 📉 even to perfectly valid words.
Without this cap, every single-word or two-word line would receive a near-zero **perplexity** 📉 component in its **quality score** 📈.

---

##### Categorisation Logic

Categorisation is a two-function split: `determine_category()` in [text_util_langID.py](text_util_langID.py)📎 holds
all of the routing logic and returns `(category, reason)`; `categorize_line()` is now a thin wrapper that calls
`determine_category()` and then clamps the stored `quality_score` to the range consistent with the returned category
so downstream analytics can rely on the score as a monotone proxy for category rank.

> [!NOTE]
> An earlier revision applied cumulative penalty subtractions to `quality_score` directly inside `categorize_line()`
> before threshold routing (visible as a commented-out block in the source). The current implementation replaces
> that cumulative-subtraction approach with the strict, ordered gate list below — the quality score itself is never
> mutated during categorisation, only read.

Checked in order — the **first** match wins and skips all remaining checks, including the quality-score band routing.
Every gate below is individually toggleable via the ablation kill-switch (`DISABLED_RULES`) and, when active, calls
`_fire(<rule_name>)` for the rule-fire coverage instrumentation (`tools/rule_coverage_report.py`).

**Four late-stage penalty gates** (checked after gate 6, before quality-score band routing). Each one, if triggered,
only forces a Trash/rescue outcome when `quality_score < CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX + 0.35` (def: **0.90**) — a line that
already scored high enough is left alone even if one of these structural red flags fires:

| Rule name                   | Condition                                                                                                      | Rationale                                                                                          |

| `rule_wqx_rot`              | (`rot_ratio > 0.50` **or** `wqx_ratio > 0.10`) **and** `orig_lang_score < 0.75` **and not** `is_upright_czech` | Rotated/mirrored-glyph density or w/q/x-heavy tokens combined with a weak original language guess. |
| `rule_vowelless`            | `word_count ≤ 3` **and** `vowel_ratio < 0.30` **and not** `is_upright_czech` **and** the line is all-caps      | Short, vowel-starved, all-caps fragments (`WVL A`).                                                |
| `rule_ledger_fragmentation` | `len(words) ≥ 4` **and** more than 60% of tokens are bare digits or ≤ 2 characters                             | Table/ledger fragmentation loophole — mostly numeric or 1–2 char tokens.                           |
| `rule_mid_uppercase`        | `word_count ≤ 2` **and** any token has unexpected mid-word uppercase                                           | Isolated mid-uppercase fragments (`ClAŕ`).                                                         |

When one of these fires **and** `quality_score < 0.90`, the outcome is resolved by `check_rescues()`, in order:
1. If `rule_trailing_fill_rescue` fires (see below) → `Noisy` / `noisy_threshold`.
2. Else if the line is `forgiven` → `Noisy` / `noisy_threshold`.
3. Else → `Trash` / `trash_threshold`.

**`rule_trailing_fill_rescue` (`_trailing_fill_rescued()`)** — used both at gate 4 and inside `check_rescues()`: if
stripping trailing fill characters (spaces, `._:-–—<`) from the line leaves a non-empty, structurally clean core
(`compute_garbage_density(core) < CATEG_GARBAGE_DENSITY_HIGH`) that either contains a Czech diacritic or is short
(`word_count ≤ 4` and `len ≤ 25`), and `valid_word_ratio > 0.0`, the line is rescued rather than dropped straight to
Trash. This protects genuine short entries that trail off with punctuation/dashes (common in tabular archival forms).

**Quality-score band routing** (reached only if none of the gates above returned):

```text
quality_score < CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX  (def: 0.55)  →  check_rescues()  (Trash, unless rescued to Noisy)
quality_score ≥ CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX:
    valid_word_ratio < MOSTLY_READABLE_VALID_MIN (def: 0.85) AND NOT lm_confident_czech  →  Noisy (noisy_threshold)
    otherwise                                                                            →  Clear (clear_threshold)
```

`lm_confident_czech` (`_lm_confident_czech()`) is true when `is_upright_czech` **and** `ppl < LOWPPL_CZECH_CLEAR_MAX`
(def: 180.0) **and** `garbage_density < CZECH_CLEAR_GARBAGE_MAX` (def: 0.15) — a confidently-Czech, low-perplexity,
structurally clean line is allowed through to `Clear` even if `valid_word_ratio` dips below the mostly-readable floor.

**Score clamping after category assignment.** `categorize_line()` clamps the stored `quality_score` 📈 to the range
corresponding to the assigned band, so the **CSV** 📊 value is always internally consistent with the `categ` label:

* `Trash` → score clamped to `min(qs, CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX − ε)` — always below 0.55
* `Noisy` → score clamped to `[CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX, CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX − ε]` — always in `[0.55, 0.80)`
* `Clear` → score clamped to `max(qs, CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX)` — always ≥ 0.80

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX` defaults to **0.80**, not 0.85 as stated in earlier revisions of this document. The `Noisy`
> band is therefore `[0.55, 0.80)` and `Clear` is `≥ 0.80` at default configuration.

##### Post-Processing Smoothing

After all lines in a document are classified and written to **CSV** 📊, `apply_document_postprocessing()` in
[langID_classify.py](langID_classify.py)📎 runs three passes, **in this order**, before the file is finalized. This
same function is reused byte-for-byte by the offline re-scorer (`tools/recategorize_from_csv.py`), so production
output and offline re-measurement never drift.

**1. Header/footer deduplication.** All occurrences of the exact same text string across a document are identified.
If the same string has been assigned to different categories on different pages (e.g., `Obr. 1. SKUHROV NAD BĚLOU`
is `Clear` on page 3 but `Noisy` on page 4 due to slightly different surrounding context affecting the LM), all
occurrences are harmonised to the **statistical mode** — the category assigned most frequently to that string across
the document. **Recorded as** `pp_dedup`.

*Why:* Repeating strings are boilerplate — page headers, footers, running titles, standard form labels. The same
physical text should receive the same label throughout a document, and the majority vote across its occurrences is
the most reliable estimate of the correct category.

**2. Rolling-window surrounded-Trash smoothing.** Scans the document line-by-line (documents with fewer than 5 lines
are skipped entirely). If a `Noisy` ⚠️ line is surrounded by `Trash` 🗑 on both sides in a 5-line window (positions
−2 and −1 are `Trash` 🗑 **and** positions +1 and +2 are `Trash` 🗑), **and** the line's quality score is below
`CATEG_TRASH_SCORE_MAX + SURROUNDED_TRASH_QS_MARGIN` (default: **0.70**), it is downgraded to `Trash` 🗑. **Recorded as** `pp_surrounded_trash`.

*Why:* A single `Noisy` ⚠️ island embedded in four consecutive `Trash` 🗑️ lines is almost certainly corrupted text
that narrowly escaped the `Trash` 🗑 threshold. The score guard ensures that only near-boundary `Noisy` ⚠️ lines are
affected — a `Noisy` ⚠️ line with a quality score of 0.78 is left alone even in a `Trash` 🗑 neighbourhood.

**3. Page-context rules.** For each page, two symmetric page-level rules run on top of the categories left by passes
1–2, using `median_qs`, `clear_ratio`, and the fraction of lines in a trusted language (`decent_lang_ratio`, over
`EXPECTED_LANGS ∪ TRUSTED_FOREIGN_LANGS`):

* **Heavily-garbage pages:** if a page's `Clear` ratio is `≤ PAGE_GARBAGE_CLEAR_MAX` (def: 0.05), its trusted-language
  ratio is `< PAGE_GARBAGE_LANG_MAX` (def: 0.50), and its median quality score is `< PAGE_GARBAGE_MEDIAN_QS_MAX`
  (def: 0.55), every `Noisy` line on that page scoring below `PAGE_GARBAGE_NOISY_QS_MAX` (def: 0.80) is downgraded to `Trash`.
* **Predominantly-clean pages:** if a page's `Clear` ratio is `> PAGE_CLEAN_CLEAR_MIN` (def: 0.60) and its median
  quality score is `> PAGE_CLEAN_MEDIAN_QS_MIN` (def: 0.80), every `Trash` line on that page scoring
  `≥ PAGE_CLEAN_RECOVER_QS_MIN` (def: 0.45) *and* in a trusted language is promoted to `Noisy`.

**Recorded as** `pp_page_context`.

*Why:* A page that is almost entirely garbage rarely contains a genuinely-recoverable `Noisy` line; a page that is
almost entirely clean rarely contains a genuinely-unrecoverable `Trash` line. These rules use the page as additional
context the per-line categoriser cannot see.

**4. Page-level inverted-scan sweep.** Run last, independently per page, over every line not already `Empty`/`Non-text`.
A line is **suspicious** when it meets **any** of three detection arms:

* **Diacritic-absence arm:** the line lacks Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics **and** has a stored `lang_score < LANG_SCORE_ROUGH` (def: 0.45).
* **Perplexity/weirdness arm:** `perplex ≥ PPL_INVERTED_MIN` (def: 200.0) **and** `word_weird > 0.0` **and** `lang_score < ROT_HIGH_LANG_CONF` (def: 0.90). No `rot_ratio` requirement.
* **Rotation arm:** the line lacks Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics **and** `rot_ratio ≥ ROT_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN` (def: 0.55) **and** `perplex ≥ PPL_INVERTED_MIN` **and** `lang_score < ROT_HIGH_LANG_CONF`.

> [!NOTE]
> Earlier revisions of this document described only two arms and explicitly flagged that `rot_ratio` was computed
> but never actually gated the page-level sweep. That is no longer accurate: the current implementation adds a third,
> **rotation arm** that does condition on `rot_ratio ≥ ROT_RATIO_INVERTED_MIN`, alongside a perplexity/weirdness arm
> that (like before) does not use `rot_ratio` at all. There is no code/doc discrepancy to flag here anymore.

Suspicious lines are downgraded to `Trash` when either:
* they make up **≥ `INVERTED_PAGE_MAJORITY`** (default **0.60**) of the page's scoreable lines — the **page-majority arm**, checked first, applied to the whole page and skipping the run-based rule for that page; **or**
* absent a page-majority, they form a **contiguous run of `≥ INVERTED_RUN_MIN`** (default **4**) suspicious lines.

**Recorded as** `pp_inverted_run`.

*Why a page-majority arm?* Some inverted/garbage scans break up into many short, isolated fragments separated by
`Empty`🫙 lines, `Non-text`🔣 stamps, or single-token noise, so the suspicious lines never form a single run of four
and escape the run-based rule. When the **majority** of a page's scoreable lines are individually suspicious, the
page as a whole is treated as an inverted/garbage scan and every suspicious line on it is downgraded, regardless of
run length. Lines carrying Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics or a confident **FastText** 🌐 score are never suspicious, so genuine
content interleaved on the page is preserved.

*Why three arms?* Inverted-scan pages sometimes produce partial Czech 🇨🇿 diacritics: the **OCR** 🔍 engine recognises
some upside-down glyphs as plausible Latin characters and occasionally matches diacritical forms. The diacritic-absence
arm alone would miss these pages. The perplexity/weirdness arm and the rotation arm each catch them independently —
one using LM uncertainty plus word-level weirdness, the other using the character-shape rotation signal together with
LM uncertainty — without requiring the absence of diacritics on their own.

The table below consolidates every factor that influences `quality_score` 📈 or the final category assignment, including
where each factor is controlled and any known edge cases. This replaces the previous version of this table, which
still referenced the now-removed "Override 4" clean-prose promotion and the old `CATEG_NOISY_SCORE_MAX = 0.85` default.

#### 4.2 Aggregate Statistics (Memory Bound) 🧠

This script processes the `DOC_LINE_LANG_CLASS/` directory with **CSV** 📊 files in chunks 🧩 to produce
final page-level statistics. It is **CPU** 💻-bound and parallelized with `ProcessPoolExecutor`.

```
python3 langID_aggregate_STAT.py
```

* **Input 📥:** `DOC_LINE_LANG_CLASS/` (directory with **CSV** 📊 files from the previous step)
* **Output 1 📤:** `final_page_stats.csv` 📊 (configurable via `OUTPUT_STATS`) — global page-level summary across all documents
* **Output 2 📤:** `DOC_LINE_STAT/` (configurable via `OUTPUT_DOC_DIR`) — per-document **CSVs** 📊 with the same schema

For each page, the aggregation computes features outputted in the following strict schema order:

**Totals & Counts:**

* `num_lines` — the total number of valid lines processed on the page
* `Clear`, `Noisy`, `Trash`, `Non-text`, `Empty` — integer count of lines in each category
* `total_word_count` — total number of words across scoreable lines
* `total_char_count` — total number of characters across scoreable lines

**Averages** (mean over the same `Clear` ✅ and `Noisy` ⚠️ lines):

* `avg_quality_score` — mean composite **quality score** 📈 in [0, 1]; higher = cleaner **OCR** 🔍 output
* `avg_word_weird` — mean per-word weirdness ratio in [0, 1]; 0 = fully clean, lower is better 📉
* `avg_lang_score` — mean **FastText** 🌐 confidence score
* `avg_perplex` — mean **Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 **perplexity** 📉 score
* `avg_vowel_ratio` — mean vowel-to-alphabetic-character ratio per line
* `avg_rot_ratio` — mean rotatable character ratio per line
* `ch_ratio` — mean fraction of lines flagged as all-caps headers (`caps_header = True`)

**Language profile:**

* `main_lang` — the statistical mode (most frequent) language 🌐 predicted for the page

> [!NOTE]
> `avg_*` columns and `main_lang` will be `NaN` / `None` for pages whose only lines are
> `Empty` or `Non-text` (i.e., pages with no scoreable text content).
> Additional per-line diagnostic variables (e.g. `weird_wx`, `original_lang`, `original_text`) and flags added
> and ignored for this page-level aggregation to ensure stability.

All numeric averages are rounded to 4 decimal places; totals are stored as integers.

```

This is the end of the text quality classification and filtering step. You can now use [arup_page_stats_SHORT.csv](data_samples/arup_page_stats_SHORT.csv) 📎 to
identify files that need another round of **OCR** 🔍 or manual correction based on the line type counts. Pages with the
majority of **Clear** ✅ lines can be marked for further processing. The absence of clear lines combined with a high proportion
of **Trash** 🗑️ lines may also indicate handwritten content, which can be excluded before Handwritten Text Recognition (HTR) is applied.

## API Service Integration

In addition to the batch pipeline, this repository ships with a FastAPI wrapper (`service/text_api.py`) that exposes
the core `text_util_langID` quality classification engine over HTTP.

The batch pipeline and the API service share the same `text_util_langID` categorization engine and `config_langID.txt`
settings — including the default **Qwen2.5-0.5B** 🤖 perplexity model — to ensure zero drift between local processing
and web uploads.

For deployment instructions, endpoint specifications (`/process`, `/info`), and frontend integration details,
please see the dedicated **[Service Documentation](service/README.md)**.

## Paradata logging

This project incorporates a unified provenance and **paradata** 🗒️ logging system to seamlessly track the execution
details of every pipeline stage. The logger automatically captures run-time metadata and saves it in a
structured **JSON** 📄 format.

**What gets logged?**

* **Provenance 🏛️:** Captures the tool name, a tool **version** 🏷️ tag, the repository/runner reference, the running
container image (when set), the **Python** 🐍 version, and assigns a unique `run_id` to each execution. The repository
reference is resolved **dynamically** — environment overrides (`ATRIUM_RUNNER_REPO`, `ATRIUM_RUNNER_REF`,
`ATRIUM_RUNNER_IMAGE`) take precedence over the static fallback in [para_config.txt](para_config.txt) 📎 — so the log
points at the image actually executing rather than a fixed fork.
* **Output license ⚖️:** Computes the **effective output license** 📜 of the run from the licensed components it actually
exercised, and records it as `license` / `license_url` plus a detailed `license_detail` block (per-component licenses,
which component(s) `determined_by` the result, `is_non_commercial` / `is_share_alike` flags, and any unknown licenses).
See [Output licensing](#output-licensing-) below.
* **Configuration ⚙️:** Stores run-time configuration ⚙️, including script
names, input/output paths, and specific model choices.
* **Timing ⏱️:** Records precise UTC start times, end times, and the total duration of the run in seconds.
* **Statistics 📊:** Tracks the total number of input files, successfully processed documents, and computes performance
throughput (e.g., output files generated per minute).
* **Error Tracking 🐛:** Maintains a `skipped_files_detail` list that logs the exact filename and specific error reason
if a file fails to process.

**Log Location**

By default, **JSON** 📄 logs are written to the [paradata](paradata) 📁 directory following the naming convention
`<YYMMDD-HHmmss>_<program>.json`. Paradata is intended to live alongside the **outputs** 📤 (not committed to the
repository); the **paradata** 🗒️ JSON files themselves are distributed under the **CC BY-NC 4.0** license.

### Output licensing ⚖️

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The license of the files a run **produces** is **not fixed** — it is computed per run as the **most restrictive**
> license among the components (models, data, APIs) that the run actually used. The mechanism is data-driven via
> [para_config.txt](para_config.txt) 📎 (component → license) and [para_licenses.py](para_licenses.py) 📎
> (restrictiveness ranking + share-alike / non-commercial rules), so the licensing owner can adjust it without touching
> the logger.

Each repository ships a [para_config.txt](para_config.txt) 📎 listing its components. Components flagged `always` count
toward every run (the worst-case baseline); components flagged `conditional` are only counted when the script that uses
them records it. For this repository the components and their effect on the **effective output license** 📜 are:

| Component                                                                              | License         | Counted     | Used by                                                        |
|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-----------------|-------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|

Because the always-on **FastText** 🌐 weights are **CC BY-NC 4.0**, the baseline effective output license for this
repository is **CC BY-NC 4.0** (non-commercial). Runs that additionally use the **LayoutReader** 📐 method escalate to
**CC BY-NC-SA 4.0** (non-commercial **and** share-alike), the most restrictive option here. A run that exercised only
permissive components would resolve to **Apache-2.0**.

> [!NOTE]
> The restrictiveness ordering encoded in [para_licenses.py](para_licenses.py) 📎 is a mechanical engineering
> approximation, **not legal advice**; unrecognised licenses are treated conservatively as maximally restrictive so a
> missing entry can never silently relax the recorded output license.
